## **Core Voice Attributes**

**Our voice is:**

- **Conversational** – Natural, not corporate
- **Encouraging** – Celebrates progress, big or small
- **Reflective** – Thoughtful, not rushed
- **Designer-friendly** – Understands the creative process

**Our voice is NOT:**
- Corporate or clinical
- Overly technical
- Pushy or demanding
- Robotic or generic

---

## **Tone by Context**

### **Onboarding (Welcoming & Informative)**
- Excited to meet them, but not overwhelming
- Clear instructions without being bossy
- Build trust around privacy and data

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Track your creative work and discover what brings you joy."
- ❌ "Sign in to start tracking your creative journey and discover what brings you joy." (too wordy)

---

### **Daily Use (Supportive & Light)**
- Encouraging without being overbearing
- Acknowledge their work with warmth
- Make it feel effortless

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Capture the moment" (CTA)
- ✅ "What did you work on today?" (greeting)
- ❌ "Log your tasks now" (too demanding)

---

### **Reflections & Insights (Thoughtful & Poetic)**
- Use poetic, meaningful language
- Help them see patterns, not just data
- Focus on feelings and growth

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Creative tasks that involved visual thinking energized you."
- ✅ "Tasks that ignited your creativity — exploring ideas, experimenting, or discovering."
- ❌ "You worked on 5 creative tasks this week." (too dry)

---

### **Historical Entries (Casual & Playful)**
- Gentle reminders about read-only content
- Use humor to soften restrictions

**Examples:**
- ✅ "That day's already journaled into history. Let it chill."
- ❌ "This entry is read-only and cannot be edited." (too formal)

---

### **Settings & Data Management (Clear & Reassuring)**
- Explain what happens without jargon
- Be transparent about privacy and data
- Use friendly confirmations

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Delete everything? You can't undo this."
- ✅ "Last chance. Your reflections will be gone forever. Really delete?"
- ❌ "Are you sure you want to permanently delete all data?" (too formal)

---

### **Errors & Empty States (Gentle & Helpful)**
- Never blame the user
- Offer clear next steps
- Keep it light

**Examples:**
- ✅ "No reflections yet. Start tracking your work to see your history here."
- ✅ "Hmm, I didn't catch any project names. Try something like: 'NetSave 2, K12 visual UI' or type 'skip'."
- ❌ "Error: No entries found." (too technical)

---

## **Writing Principles**

### **1. Use Active Voice**
- ✅ "Track your creative work"
- ❌ "Your creative work can be tracked"

### **2. Write in Second Person**
- ✅ "What did you work on today?"
- ❌ "What did the user work on today?"

### **3. Be Concise (But Not Cold)**
- ✅ "This helps us give you better insights."
- ❌ "This helps personalize your experience and provide better insights."

### **4. Use Contractions**
- ✅ "You can't undo this."
- ❌ "You cannot undo this."

### **5. Avoid Jargon**
- ✅ "Check for Issues" / "Scan and repair broken links"
- ❌ "Check Data Integrity" / "Find and fix data issues"

### **6. Ask Questions (Not Commands)**
- ✅ "What did you work on for NetSave?"
- ❌ "Enter the task you worked on for NetSave."

## **Testing Your Copy**

Before publishing, ask:

1. **Is it conversational?** → Read it out loud. Would you say it to a friend?
2. **Is it clear?** → Can a designer understand it without explanation?
3. **Is it warm?** → Does it feel supportive, not robotic?
4. **Is it concise?** → Can you remove words without losing meaning?
5. **Is it consistent?** → Does it match the voice in other screens?
