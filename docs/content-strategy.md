# Content Strategy: Designer's Life Tracker

This document outlines our content approach, principles, and guidelines for future features.

---

## **Content Mission**

**We help designers understand and celebrate their creative work through warm, reflective language that honors both the process and the emotions behind it.**

---

## **Content Principles**

### **1. Emotion First, Data Second**
We don't just track tasks‚Äîwe help designers understand how their work makes them *feel*.

**In Practice:**
- Lead with feelings, not metrics
- Use poetic language for insights
- Celebrate emotional patterns, not just productivity

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "Creative tasks that involved visual thinking energized you."
- ‚ùå "You completed 5 tasks with an average emotion rating of 8.2."

---

### **2. Reflection Over Logging**
This isn't a to-do list‚Äîit's a journal for creative work.

**In Practice:**
- Use "reflection" instead of "entry" or "log"
- Frame actions as thoughtful, not mechanical
- Encourage pause and introspection

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "Capture the moment"
- ‚ùå "Log task"

---

### **3. Designer-Centric Language**
We speak the language of designers‚Äîcreative, visual, process-oriented.

**In Practice:**
- Use design terminology naturally (e.g., "flow state," "visual thinking")
- Reference creative struggles and wins
- Avoid generic productivity language

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "Exploratory design work lit up your curiosity."
- ‚ùå "You were productive this week."

---

### **4. Warmth Without Clutter**
Be friendly, but respect the user's time and attention.

**In Practice:**
- Short, meaningful sentences
- Emojis sparingly (only where they add warmth)
- White space and breathing room

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "No reflections yet. Start tracking your work to see your history here."
- ‚ùå "üëã Hey there! üé® It looks like you haven't added any reflections yet! üìù Why not start tracking your awesome design work today? üöÄ"

---

### **5. Conversational, Not Corporate**
Write like a supportive mentor, not a productivity app.

**In Practice:**
- Use contractions
- Ask questions
- Acknowledge feelings
- Keep it human

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "That day's already journaled into history. Let it chill."
- ‚ùå "This entry is read-only and cannot be modified."
