## **✏️ Before Publishing, Ask:**

1. Would I say this to a designer friend? → **Conversational?**
2. Can they understand it without explanation? → **Clear?**
3. Does it feel supportive, not robotic? → **Warm?**
4. Can I remove words without losing meaning? → **Concise?**
5. Does it match the voice on other screens? → **Consistent?**

## **🚫 Never Say:**

- "Please enter..."
- "Data integrity"
- "Submit"
- "Error:"
- "Invalid input"
- "Check in"
- "Entry"
- "Log task"

---

## **❤️ Always Say:**

- "Capture the moment"
- "What did you work on today?"
- "Hey {userName}"
- "No worries!"
- "That day's already journaled into history. Let it chill."
- "This helps us give you better insights."
