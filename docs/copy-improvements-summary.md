## **üìù Testing Checklist**

Before deploying, verify:

- [ ] All button text is clear and actionable
- [ ] Navigation labels are consistent across screens
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs explain actions clearly

- [ ] No jargon or technical terms in user-facing copy
- [ ] Grammar and punctuation are correct
- [ ] Tone matches context (playful vs. professional)

---

## **üí¨ User Testing Questions**

When testing with users, ask:

1. **Clarity**: "Is any text confusing or unclear?"
2. **Tone**: "How would you describe the app's personality?"
3. **Trust**: "Do you feel your data is private and secure?"
4. **Encouragement**: "Does the app motivate you to reflect?"
5. **Consistency**: "Does the language feel consistent throughout?"

## **üìà Success Metrics**

Track these to measure copy effectiveness:

- **Onboarding completion rate** (clearer copy should increase)
- **Daily active users** (warm tone should increase retention)
- **Support tickets about unclear UI** (should decrease)
- **User feedback sentiment** (should be more positive)
- **Task completion time** (clear copy should reduce friction)

All copy changes align with existing design system:
- Typography hierarchy maintained
- Button styles unchanged
- Color scheme intact
- Layout structure preserved
- **Only text content updated**
