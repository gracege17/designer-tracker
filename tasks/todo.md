## üîÑ Task Workflow

### When Starting a Task:
1. Move from `[todo]` to `[in-progress]`
2. Use this prompt with Cursor AI:
```
Let's start this task: "[task name]"

Goal: Help designers reflect on daily work in under 3 minutes
```

### When Testing a Task:
1. Move from `[in-progress]` to `[review]`
2. Test manually on device/simulator
3. Check against acceptance criteria from PRD
4. Verify 3-minute rule compliance for user-facing features
5. Test accessibility and mobile-first design

### When Completing a Task:
1. Move from `[review]` to `[done]`
2. Move completed task to archive.md
3. Commit changes to git with descriptive message
4. Update any related documentation

### If Task is Blocked:
1. Mark as `[blocked]`
2. Note what's blocking it and estimated resolution time
3. Work on other tasks or resolve blocker
4. Consider if blocker affects other tasks

## üìù Implementation Notes & Decisions

### Current Focus:
‚úÖ **MILESTONE 1: COMPLETED** - Foundation Setup
‚úÖ **MILESTONE 2: COMPLETED** - Core Logging Flow  
‚úÖ **MILESTONE 3: COMPLETED** - Insights & Analytics
‚úÖ **MILESTONE 4: COMPLETED** - Polish & Enhancement (All animations, onboarding, and suggestions ‚úÖ)
üéØ **NEXT: MILESTONE 5 - Launch Preparation**

### Key Design Decisions:
- **Local-First Data:** Using AsyncStorage/localStorage for privacy and simplicity
- **Emotion System:** 12 emotions with multi-select (üòäüòåüò¢üò°üò∞üéâüòëüò¥üò≤‚ö°ü•∫üôÇ)
- **3-Minute Rule:** Every user flow must be completable in under 3 minutes
- **Modern Purple Design:** Clean, minimal, soft borders, rounded corners
- **Mobile-First:** 
  - Touch targets min 44x44pt (iOS) / 48x48dp (Android)
  - Bottom navigation for thumb reach
  - Large tap areas with clear visual feedback
  - Optimized for one-handed use
  - Safe area aware (notch, home indicator)
  - Responsive to text size preferences

### Technical Architecture:
- **Navigation:** React Navigation Stack Navigator
- **State Management:** React hooks + Context API (simple, no Redux needed)
- **Data Models:** TypeScript interfaces with JSON storage
- **Styling:** NativeWind (Tailwind CSS) with custom warm color palette
- **Testing:** Manual testing on iOS/Android simulators + Expo Go

### User Experience Priorities:
1. **Speed:** Quick daily logging (under 3 minutes)
2. **Emotional Safety:** Non-judgmental, encouraging language
3. **Privacy:** All data stays local on device
4. **Accessibility:** Screen reader support, high contrast
5. **Offline-First:** Works without internet connection

### Questions for Implementation:
- [ ] Should we add data export/import for device transfers?
- [ ] How detailed should the task type categories be?
- [ ] What's the minimum data needed before showing insights?
- [ ] Should we include push notifications for gentle reminders?
